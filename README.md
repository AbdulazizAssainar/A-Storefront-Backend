# Storefront Backend Project

## Getting Started

This repo contains a basic Node and Express app to get you started in constructing an API. To get started, clone this repo and run `yarn` in your terminal at the project root.

## Required Technologies
Your application must make use of the following libraries:
- Postgres for the database
- Node/Express for the application logic
- dotenv from npm for managing environment variables
- db-migrate from npm for migrations
- jsonwebtoken from npm for working with JWTs
- jasmine from npm for testing

## Steps to Completion

### 1. Plan to Meet Requirements

In this repo there is a `REQUIREMENTS.md` document which outlines what this API needs to supply for the frontend, as well as the agreed upon data shapes to be passed between front and backend. This is much like a document you might come across in real life when building or extending an API. 

Your first task is to read the requirements and update the document with the following:
- Determine the RESTful route for each endpoint listed. Add the RESTful route and HTTP verb to the document so that the frontend developer can begin to build their fetch requests.    
**Example**: A SHOW route: 'blogs/:id' [GET] 

- Design the Postgres database tables based off the data shape requirements. Add to the requirements document the database tables and columns being sure to mark foreign keys.   
**Example**: You can format this however you like but these types of information should be provided
Table: Books (id:varchar, title:varchar, author:varchar, published_year:varchar, publisher_id:string[foreign key to publishers table], pages:number)

**NOTE** It is important to remember that there might not be a one to one ratio between data shapes and database tables. Data shapes only outline the structure of objects being passed between frontend and API, the database may need multiple tables to store a single shape. 

## 1. Test: npm run test
#### API Endpoints
- Order 
- Product
- Ordered Products
- User


#### Users
- Index [token required]
- Show [token required]
- Create N[token required]

#### Orders
- Current Order by user (args: user id)[token required]
- [OPTIONAL] Completed Orders by user (args: user id)[token required]

## Data Shapes
#### Product
-  id
- name
- price
- [OPTIONAL] category

#### User
- id
- firstName
- lastName
- password

#### Orders
- id
- id of each product in the order
- quantity of each product in the order
- user_id
- status of order (active or complete)
